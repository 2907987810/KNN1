Contributing to the documentation
=================================

Where to start?
---------------

Please follow the documentation in ``doc/source/contributing.rst`` for a 
detailed guide on how to contribute to documentation

There are a number of issues listed under `Docs
<https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues?labels=Docs&sort=updated&state=open>`_
and `good first issue
<https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues?labels=good+first+issue&sort=updated&state=open>`_
where you could start out.

Or maybe you have an idea of your own, by using pandas, looking for something
in the documentation and thinking 'this can be improved', let's do something
about that!

Feel free to ask questions on `mailing list
<https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/pydata>`_ or submit an
issue on Github.
