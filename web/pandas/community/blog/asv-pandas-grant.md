# What we learn on the Pandas grant

*By Dorothy Kabarozi B. and Lucy Jiménez*

We want to share with you our experience working on **Small development**
**grants: ASV improvements + Docstrings and diversity** provided by
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) core team and [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/).

This grant was focusing on two aspects: the first one is to improve the
asv library, a tool used by benchmarking Python packages and used by
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/speed/pandas/), and the second one
is to encourage more underrepresented groups to contribute to Open
Source projects. This grant was held over 10 weeks, working around 20
hours a week, and was developed by Dorothy Kabarozi .B. from Uganda and
Lucy Jiménez from Colombia,under the mentoring of Marc Garcia.

### Why were we part of the grant?
Even when we come from different backgrounds, Dorothy from systems engineering
and Lucy from computational chemistry, we have always been interested in
participating and contributing to open-source software projects. For that
reason, we have been running the Pyladies meetups in our communities
(PyLadies Kampala, PyLadies Colombia).

### Learning from the source code
At the beginning of the grant, we started from the basics. We noticed that
our skills in managing Git and GitHub could be improved. For example, we
had some troubles with the git workflow, so we had to read and practice more
about it. One of the useful resources was the explanation from Marc about
[how to make an open-source contribution](https://tubedu.org/w/kjnHEg72j76StmSFmjzbnE),
which we invite you to take a look at.

Through this grant, we were able to learn a lot from the source code and gained
immense knowledge about best practices and code quality. We have been working on
updating the code to improve the style to follow the PEP-8 guidelines, remove
Python2 compatibility code and six dependencies, and find unused code and remove
it. We also learned about GitHub actions, we started building the CI on GitHub
actions for the asv package; for that we have been working on add linting with
Flake8, testing with pytest, building docs, and running CI on different
python versions.

Additionally, we were able to identify bugs in the source code, review pull-request
from other contributors, and create new issues, something we thought only
maintainers can do but not contributors. Finally, not only is reviewing
the code itself a learning experience but also the structure and folder
hierarchy in the project started to be more clear.

### Improving our soft skills and teamwork
For this adventure, we had an amazing Mentor, Marc Garcia, he was always willing to
share his knowledge, explain unclear concepts and share helpful feedback along the
way. Whenever we would implement that feedback it felt easier to work on more
issues faster. We felt the growth from the time we started on this project and
we will carry it along as we contribute to more Open Source projects, and this
really all goes back to Marc for his amazing mentorship. It is also important to
note that during this process we received feedback from other contributors, stakeholders,
and core devs, which gave us a broader look at the work in Open Source projects.

We also built a strong teamwork partnership. We helped each other a lot as we had
numerous one-on-one calls just to understand the tasks better, we always looked for
ways to support each other from the technical side and also provide words of
encouragement when needed, like “You can do it” which pushed us through the
uncomfortable learning phases. For us, it was professional and human growth.

The knowledge and experience acquired in this process allowed us to organize two
virtual sprints. These events were carried out in the company of local PyLadies
communities, the first one was on February 26th with PyLadies Kampala, and on
March 21st with PyLadies Colombia. At these events, we practiced how to mentor
others, and reinforce the knowledge acquired to contribute to open source. Most
new contributors were able to learn and create new pull-requests and had them
merged which was one of the greatest achievements.

### Conclusion 
In conclusion, we learned a lot from this experience from the code part,
the workflow on the open-source projects, how to be resilient in difficult
moments, and also encouraging more women and people from our local
communities to contribute to Open Source projects.

Finally, if you want to be part of an open-source project, we invite you to check
out GitHub repos for different projects you are interested in and search for the
easy issues to work on and get started. Also you can contact the maintainers of
the projects with specific questions, search for the open-source communities in
your country or contact us for more help.

### Acknowledgments
Many many thanks to [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/) for giving us this support
through small grants, and Marc for the great mentoring he generously gave us all
through these weeks.

Looking forward to contributing more and making an impact in our communities and
also the open-source community!
